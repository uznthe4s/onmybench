        Hey, I'm John Dennison and this is my site.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Today is a good day. The sun is out, the air is warm and my dog is curled up at my feet. There are a great many things to understand if anyone is going to try and know me.
            Before I go and introduce myself, know that what you see is what you will get. With that out of the way, greetings from Earth. I am a Human. That is to say that I am 
            a Human and also that I am human. I know that that is the same as describing a thing as it relates to being itself but let us just leave it at that. 
            Johnathan, John and Hey You are all the same being and just like the Universe I am under no obligation to explain myself to anyone which also includes myself. 
            I cannot explain who I am even to myself; so trying to explain to anyone else is tantamount to suicide. But I shall try my best regardless. 
          </p>
          
          <p>First and foremost, I am a Dad. This encompasses who and what I am and how I am. Like saying I am a human. It is all that I am and yet not entirely who I pretend
            to be. I wake up to my son crying or walking around in his room above mine about the same time every morning. I stretch, wiggle my toes and with the fog of sleep stil 
            hanging thick in my mind I ascend the stairs to welcome him to a new day. Until I kiss him goodnight, he is very much a huge part of my world. It is not until 
            I hear silence from his room at night that my day has ended and I can rest.
          </p>
          
          <p>Second and yet not any bit second, I am a Husbund. With all that that entails I do my best to live up to the grand expectations placed upon with by that destinction.
            Being a Husbund, like being a Dad and furthermore like being Human, both describes me and is me. I am there for my Wife Kim; as she is there for me. We are; period.
            It is and of what we do both for eachother and for ourselves. Building a marriage is like building a House and turning it into a home. As one can both describe a thing
            and be the thing and yet be completely different. A house can be anything that covers a persons head, but a home, a home is made. A marriage is made. Built with effort.
            Assembled togather from many pieces and parts; gathered by two people and bonded with love. Each person brings their own materials; yet neither having all the components
            required. When two people bring all they have into a house only then do they have all that is required to make it a Home. This is why being a Husbund to my wife, a Dad to 
            my son, and a being a Human is synonimous. It is all who I am and what I am. I am Me and these few things are what I am; these are what it takes to know me. I am Johnathan,
            and it is my pleasure to introduce myself to you.
